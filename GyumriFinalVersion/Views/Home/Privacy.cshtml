                    Your privacy matters to us. This website is committed to protecting your personal information and being
                    transparent about how we collect, use, and store data. Below is a summary of what you need to know.
                </p>

                <h2>What We Collect</h2>
                <p>We only collect the information you choose to share with us, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Event-related information when you use the <strong>Submit an Event</strong> form
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anonymous browsing data (like location and device type) to help us improve user experience and offer a
                        best experience for features like "Plan A Trip".
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why We Collect It</h2>
                <p>We collect this data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate responses to your questions</li>
                    <li>Feature events submitted by users</li>
                    <li>Improve website performance and content based on visitor behavior</li>
                    <li>Ensure a smooth, secure experience for all visitors</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How We Store & Protect It</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data is stored securely on servers managed by our technology partner. We use industry-standard
                    security measures to protect it from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.
                </p>
                <p class="bold-text">We never sell your data to third parties. Ever.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Tools</h2>
                <p>
                    We may use services like Google Analytics, social media integrations (e.g. Instagram embeds), or email
                    marketing tools to better understand usage and reach. These platforms have their own privacy policies,
                    which we recommend reviewing.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Choices</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Choose not to provide personal data by avoiding forms and interactive tools</li>
                    <li>
                        Request that we delete any personal information you've submitted via email:
